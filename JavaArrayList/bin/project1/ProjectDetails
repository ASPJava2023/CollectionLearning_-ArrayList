Student Management System Project:

A common and useful project that leverages the ArrayList concept in Java is a simple Student Management System. This project involves creating a system to manage a list of students with their details. Here's a basic outline of the project:

Requirements:
Student Class:
Create a Student class with attributes such as id, name, age, and grade.
Include appropriate constructors and getter/setter methods.

Student Database:
Use an ArrayList to store instances of the Student class. This ArrayList will act as your student database.

User Interface:

Implement a simple command-line user interface to interact with the student management system.
Allow users to:
Add a new student to the system.
View the list of all students.
Search for a student by ID.
Update student details.
Delete a student from the system.
Exit application

Functionalities:

Ensure that student IDs are unique.
Implement error handling for invalid inputs.(optional)
Provide a summary of the student details, such as average grade, highest/lowest grade, etc.(optional)
